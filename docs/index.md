# parcel

Interact with [parcel](https://parceljs.org) from R, supports [npm](https://github.com/JohnCoene/npm) and [yarn](https://github.com/JohnCoene/yarn).

[Parcel.js](https://parceljs.org/) is a nice alternative to [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

There is already the [packer](http://packer.john-coene.com/) package to interact with webpack. Given the complexity of webpack the package does much of the work for the developer.

However, the simplicity of parcel.js allows a different approach: it's much less hands-on because, unlike webpack, the learning curve of parcel is very approachable.
